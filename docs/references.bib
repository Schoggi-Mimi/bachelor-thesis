    abstract = {The Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) has collected more than a decade’s worth of longitudinal and multi-modal data from patients, healthy controls, and at-risk individuals, including imaging, clinical, cognitive, and ‘omics’ biospecimens. Such a rich dataset presents unprecedented opportunities for biomarker discovery, patient subtyping, and prognostic prediction, but it also poses challenges that may require the development of novel methodological approaches to solve. In this review, we provide an overview of the application of machine learning methods to analyzing data from the PPMI cohort. We find that there is significant variability in the types of data, models, and validation procedures used across studies, and that much of what makes the PPMI data set unique (multi-modal and longitudinal observations) remains underutilized in most studies. We review each of these dimensions in detail and provide recommendations for future machine learning work using data from the PPMI cohort.},
